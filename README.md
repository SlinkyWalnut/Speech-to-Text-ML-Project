# Final Project For Intro to ML

## Made to run on Mac, will use GPU for training. IF you want to run this, just run each code block in order

## The batHappy.wav is my friend bat saying the word happy.
You can test any word you want by making a recording into a wav file then putting the path to that file in wav_file_path
